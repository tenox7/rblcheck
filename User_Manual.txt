Changes:
~~~~~~~~

   Please note there has been a major changes introduced to user-side
   of RBLCHECK in this release. If you are using any previous release
   you *MUST* update MAILsweeper configuration.
   
   Important changes: 

     1. Error exit code (NOT_CHECKED) has been changed from 3 to 2.
 
     2. Mandatory parameter <logfile> has been added. 

     3. All errors are now redirected to <logfile>. 

     4. RBLCHECK no longer will send messages to Undetermined
        on any DNS errors on timeouts. If DNS doesn't work, the
        message will be passed clean. However you may still get
	Undetermined from Executable Scenario Timeout. To avoid
	this, please follow further instructions.

   The new features and other changes:

     1. Check only IP address of the connecting host instead of scanning
        whole message. To use this enable option "-l".

     2. Scan only message header instead of whole message or the IP of
        the connecting host. To use this enable option "-h".

     3. Enable to use Windows DNS Resolver Cache to speed up DNS name
        resolution. Option: "-c".

     4. Statistics, results and particular matches can now be viewed
        in Message Viewer / Analysis if you capture %LOGTEXT%.
     
     5. Few minor changes to improve performance.


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   = MAILsweeper [MIMEsweeper] version 4.3 or higher.

     Jens.Eichler@bruderhilfe.de reported in last minute that
     RBLCHECK will work with MAILsweeper 4.2 (SP2). In my opinion
     it will however not work with -l option and you have to enable
     inserting IP addresses to headers manualy in config file (see
     configuration guide bellow).

   = Windows 2000 or higher [Tested on 2000/2003/XP].

     Alan_Kemball@evc-int.com reported in last minute that copying
     DNSAPI.DLL from Windows 2000 to NT 4.0 will allow RBLCHECK to
     run on Windows NT 4.0. However I woudn't use -c (caching) since
     Windows NT 4.0 does not have Resolver Cache.


General Usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In short, RBLCHECK takes a configuration file with list of RBL (DNSBL)
   domain names (rblservers), then it reads supplied message file and
   extracts all addresses found inside and for each IP address found,
   RBLCHECK checks it on each DNSBL server specified on the list. This
   version of RBLCHECK can also scan only message header or only the IP
   address of the connecting host.

   If number of matches from RBL servers is equal to, or more than
   the number supplied on command line, the message is classified
   as "positive" or "DETECTED". If number of matches is smaller than
   the minimum required, then it's classified as "negative" or "NONE".

   If no (0) IP addresses were found in message CLEAN (NONE) is returned.

   If no (0) valid DNS responses were returned, CLEAN (NONE) is returned.

   Following is a table of error codes and actions taken by MAILsweeper:

   Code  MSW Name     Reason      MSW Action
   -----------------------------------------------
     0   NONE         NEGATIVE    Clean
     1   DETECTED     POSITIVE    Classification
     2   NOT_CHECKED  ERROR       Undetermined
   

   In version 2.0 a great care has been taken to not return NOT_CHECKED
   on some "soft" errors such as no IP addresses found or no DNS servers
   working. RBLCHECK will however return NOT_CHECKED at early initialization
   stage, at command line syntax error, etc.


   The command line parameters are:

     rblcheck.exe [-d] [-l] [-h] [-c] <#_matches> <rblservers> <message> <log>

   Where:

     -d = debug switch (optional) - will display debugging information.
          IMPORTANT: do not use it while operating under MAILsweeper!

     -l = last, check only last IP address in the path, or in other words
          the IP address of the host connecting to MAILsweeper. If you don't
	  specify this option, RBLCHECK will scan the whole mail message
	  by default and will check *ALL* IP addresses found inside. This
	  option is recommended. However in some cases (smarthost, messages
          coming trough another mail exchanger/s or just to be more
          restrictive) you will want not to use this option.

     NOTE: -l won't work with MSW 4.2

     -h = header, scan only message header. This is somewhere in the middle
          between scanning whole message and only single IP addresses. Only
	  the SMTP message header will be scanned. This option is my personal
	  favorite over -l. Nevertheless it has some drawbacks.

     NOTE: if you won't use either -l or -h, whole message will be scanned.

     -c = cache, enable to use Windows DNS Resolver Cache to speed up
          DNS resolution. This option is recommended.

     NOTE: -l won't work with Windows NT 4.0

     <#_matches> - number of required positive matches to classify the
          message as POSITIVE (DETECTED) and return code 1. If number
	  '1' is given, single match on any rblserver will cause the
	  message to be stopped. This is the recommended setting for
	  the -l option. If you are scanning whole message (no -l) or
	  the message header (-h) - I'd suggest start with 2-3 and 
	  decrease it in time to 1, along with list of servers used. 
	  
     NOTE: I really suggest to use '1' in above settings..

     <rblservers> - full path to the textfile name containing list
          of rblservers (sample file rblservers.txt included).

     <message> - this should be the %FILENAME% token used by MAILsweeper.

     <log> - this should be the %LOGNAME% token used by MAILsweeper.


Installation instructions (for MAILsweeper):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   1. Copy "rblcheck.exe" and "rblservers.txt" to any place you choose
      on your local system. 

   2. Copy "regex.dll" to %winnt%\system32 or any place specified in
      %PATH% environment variable.

   * TIP: You can create directory like c:\rblcheck and extract all exe,
     dll and txt files there. In this case you will have to add it to the
     system %PATH% environment variable.

   3. Edit the example file rblservers.txt and remove or add any servers
      you want.  Remember - more servers, longer time it takes to check
      each mail and bigger chance of classifying innocent mail as spam.
      However more servers equals to better spam detection. With 10 DNSBL
      servers I'm getting about 80% spam blocked.
    
      As of my current knowledge there is no single comprehensive list of
      DNSBL servers available for use in RBLCHECK. Bellow is a list of all
      servers known to me:

        spews.relays.osirusoft.com 
        relays.osirusoft.com
        dnsbl.njabl.org
        bl.spamcop.net
        list.dsbl.org 
        multihop.dsbl.org
        unconfirmed.dsbl.org
        relays.ordb.org
        dynablock.wirehub.net
        blackholes.wirehub.net
        proxies.blackholes.wirehub.net
        sbl.spamhaus.org
        orbs.dorkslayers.com
        blackholes.five-ten-sg.com
        dev.null.dk

      Some of them however almost never returns any valid responses and
      some other are very slow, etc., so test them very carefully.
      For more information I recommend visiting http://www.spews.org/.

   *  IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that when not using option -l (no option
      at all or using -h) you shouldn't use servers that lists dialup
      or dynamic IP addresses.


   4. Manually test the installation by typing (in cmd.exe):

<path_to>\rblcheck.exe -d 100 <path_to>\rblservers.txt <path_to>\test.txt con

    * IMPORTANT: when specifying filenames *ALWAYS* use full path names,
      enclosed in " " if they contain white spaces.
 
      Use test.txt included in the zip file. Watch for any errors and see
      if all or your rblservers has been used. The IP address 127.0.0.2
      should be detected (marked as "POSITIVE") on each server. (This
      IP address is set on most servers as the always-match test address.)

      With <#_match> equal 100 you should get "NONE" with exit code 0 at the
      end. If you'll lower the value to 3 you should get "DETECTED" and exit
      code = 1. (With standard rblservers.txt and test.txt...). If option
      -l is used, RBLCHECK should find only 1 (single) IP address. If -h
      was used - 6 IP addresses should be scanned. In default configuration
      (no -h no -l) total 9 IP addresses should be found and scanned.
 
      The "con" parameter for <logfile> will send the output to the console.
      You can use "nul" or some file name and view it later. Debug [-d] option
      however will always print to the console.
 
      If everything is fine here. You can continue the installation.


   5. Open MAILsweeper console. Go to Scenarios->Incoming and create new
      new "Executable" scenario.

   6. For data types choose only "Container->SMTP Message"

   7. In the application location field enter or browse to the full path
      of rblcheck.exe. Remember to use full paths and enclose in double
      quotes if it contains white spaces.

   8. At the command line specify:

      <#_matches>  <full_path_to_rblservers.txt>  %FILENAME%  %LOGNAME%

      You can (should!) specify the -c, -l or -h options here. (Recommended!)

      The most standard combination is:

        -l -c 1 c:\rblcheck\rblservers.txt %FILENAME% %LOGNAME%

     or:

        -h -c 1 c:\rblcheck\rblservers.txt %FILENAME% %LOGNAME%

     or:

        3 c:\rblcheck\rblservers.txt %FILENAME% %LOGNAME%

   * IMPORTANT: Do not use -d option within MAILsweeper!

   9. Use Win32 as application type.

  10. In Advanced Properties edit the Timeout property. This
      is essential if you want to avoid "Undetermined" messages.
      The formula is:

        DNSQueryTimeout  *  No.Rblservers  =  Timeout

      DNSQueryTimeout is described later in Troubleshooting
      and Performance sections. By default it's about 20 seconds.

      Default list of Rblservers.txt contains 6 servers so the
      minimum timeout should be:

      20  *  6  =  120 seconds 

      Remember to extend the timeout or reduce DNSQueryTimeout if
      you want to use more rblservers. 

  11. DO NOT set working directory unless you have a specific 
      reason to do that and you do know exactly how it works...

   *  TIP (for advanced users): you might consider using ramdisk
      as the working directory if you have high loads of email to
      scan (more then 1-2 per second) and you don't have SCSI RAID
      controller with write-cache enabled.

  12. In Return Codes, set:

      0 for NONE
      1 for DETECTED
      2 for NOT_CHECKED

  13. In each return code description field (for all codes) enter: %LOGTEXT%
      Put this for all 3  NONE/DETECTED/NOT_CHECKED cases so in case message
      was blocked by something else, or undetermined - you will see why and
      if that was caused by RBLCHECK or not.

  14. Use classification of your choice. I recommend to create new
      classification called for example "BLACK-LISTED" and held messages
      in a quarantine + notify the sender that his message was held,
      why and what he should do about it...

  15. IMPORTANT: Enable following option in MAILsweeper:

       SMTP Relay -> Properties -> Receiver Service

       Insert IP address into Received Header for:
       = ALL CONNECTING HOSTS

      You can enable it directly in the configuration file:

      Version 4.3:

         [MailServer]
         v:IPInReceivedHeader=$Btrue
         v:IPInAllReceivedHeaders=$Btrue

      Version 4.2

         [SMTP General]
         v:IPInReceivedHeader=$I1
         v:IPinAllreceivedHeader=$I1

     
  16. Restart MAILsweeper services. Watch the system...

  17. I recommend to spend some time on fine tuning of the list of
      rblservers and number of positive matches... You can see by
      which rblserver the message was classified as positive, in
      the message viewer / analysis.

      You also should monitor Undetermined messages for possible
      problems with DNS timeouts.


Testing:
~~~~~~~~

   If you want to test if MAILsweeper and RBLCHECK are working fine
   together (however you can safely skip this point) you have
   two options depending on whenever you choose -l/-h or not.
   If not, you can simply send a message with string "127.0.0.2"
   in it and see if it's blocked.

   If you use -l or -h the life becomes more complex:

 * TIP: you can switch off -l/h for time of this test to avoid
   the hassle with telnet and use the first method.

   Login locally to the machine running MSW and open telnet.exe
   (no parameters!)

   In telnet type:

   > set localecho

   (or local_echo depending on the telnet version)

   Later:

   > open 127.0.0.2 25

   You should get connected to your MAILsweeper receiver.
   Type carefully (server output omitted):

   helo there
   mail from: test@test.com
   rcpt to: postmaster@YOURDOMAINHERE.com
   data
   From: test@test.com
   To: postmaster@YOURDOMAINHERE.com
   Subject: Spam test.

   This is a test message.
   .
   quit
   
   Don't miss the empty line after Subject line and put dot (.)
   as a single character in the last line to finish up.

   This message should be classified as a spam and send to
   adequate quarantine. You should check it in the message
   viewer / analysis.

   If in troubles or you want to trace the whole process,
   you can use -d switch and run RBLCHECK from a command
   line with a text file message to scan.

 * TIP: if you want quickly to test some IP address you can
   run RBLCHECK from the command line and specify "con" as the
   message and logfile names. You can the simply paste or type
   in the address you want to check and RBLCHECK will scan it.
   In this case DO NOT use -l option! Example:

   C:\rblcheck>rblcheck.exe 1 rblservers.txt con con
   127.0.0.2
   POSITIVE; [stats...]
   
   You probably will want to add -d to the above example.


Troubleshooting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Let me guess, it works fine from the command line but when added
   to MAILsweeper, all messages goes to "Undetermined" folder?

   1. Check if REGEX.DLL is located in a folder specified in the
      system %PATH% environment variable or in %WINNT%\system32.

   2. Go to application configuration details. Check if the command
      line contains exactly:

      [-options...] <digit> <path_to\rbservers.txt> %FILENAME% %LOGNAME%

   3. If you placed rblcheck.exe or rblservers.txt in a folder contains
      white spaces (such as "Program Files") you must enclose it with
      double quotes, for example:

      "c:\Program Files\rblcheck\rblcheck.exe"
      "c:\Program Files\rblcheck\rblservers.txt"

   4. Do not enclose whole command line in the quotes. Each element separately.

   5. If only some messages are classified as Undetermined check the
      Executable Timeout (see installation notes) in application details.

   If all this doesn't help, drop me a mail...


Performance:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Performance and support for large volume transactions is the second
   point after stability of the application. RBLCHECK was designed to
   support large amount of messages at maximum speed with some drawbacks
   enforced by MAILsweeper design.

   RBLCHECK was tested and it's used regularly on large systems with
   loads over 250.000 messages per day. If you are using it on much
   bigger systems, please contact me to share some experience.

   Also if you have any specific performance considerations just email
   me and we'll discuss the case. Bellow are few tips how to achieve
   best performance out of RBLCHECK and MAILsweeper:

   1. Always scan only SMTP Container (noted in installation guide).

   2. For maximum performance use only -l or -h options. In case of -l,
      RBLCHECK will stop after first valid IP address is found or
      after first line, if not found. In case of -h, RBLCHECK will scan
      only lines starting with word "Received" and up to end of the
      SMTP header.

   3. Use minimal (but best) rblservers.txt list. For best performance
      detection/ratio I recommend about 5 rblservers. DNS resolution is
      slowest part of all the operations.

   4. Enable use of DNS Resolver cache (option -c). You may consider to
      enlarge the cache and extend TTLs by tweaking registry options.

   5. Use data folder (you can set the working directory) only on volumes
      with Write Cache enabled. If you do not have RAID controller with
      large Write Cache I recommend use of RAMDISK driver. This is only
      for really high loads. If you have less than one message per second
      don't worry about this.

   6. Increase v:MaxJobs in MAILsweeper configuration in order to run more 
      processes simultaneously.

   7. Decrease DNS Query Timeout. However by decreasing this, you will decrease
      effectiveness or even completely disable RBLCHECK. This option is closely
      related to Scenario Execution Timeout (see previous section and
      installation instructions).

      IMPORTANT: I won't alert you about editing registry itself, but this
      particular value is of a special type and requires special care. Read
      following Resource Kit article:

http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/en-us/regentry/96406.asp


Support:
~~~~~~~~

   This application is a free, unsupported software, however you are
   most welcome to email me and ask for any help. MAILsweeper support
   forum is also a good place to start with, however I don't follow
   it regularly.

   RBLCHECK is robust and stable thanks to all people that test,
   report bugs, give me useful feedback and ask for new features.
   Many thanks!
   
   Any comments, bug reports and feature request are very appreciated!

   Commercial support, feature requests, customization and non-GNU
   licensing is also available.
